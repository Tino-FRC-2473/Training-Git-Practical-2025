I have opened the repo and started my log!

So far, I have looked through the pi to get a secret code and used it to run a decrypting algorithm to get the secret message.
Qinzhao replaced valuable lines of code with cheese.
The problem was that Qinzhao replaced random lines of code with cheese. Some lines of code include 19, 2 and 30.
So far, I have searched the repository history where Qinzhao replaced lines of code with cheese and reverted that commit.
Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
Request timeout for icmp_seq 2
Request timeout for icmp_seq 3
Request timeout for icmp_seq 4
Request timeout for icmp_seq 5
So far, I have acessed a secret message from the pi and decrypted it using a reversible encryptor to get a logo of some kind.
